# Portfolio - Final Project @ GA

Made with React and Sanity.io,
Styled with Tailwind CSS.


### Strengths 
I loved teaching myself this new framework. This project really made me fall in love with inline styling. I didn't realize how quick and easy it would be as long as components were well organized.
